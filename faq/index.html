      <p><b>What type of salsa do you teach?</b></p>
      <p>
        We teach LA style, linear salsa in partner dance. In the last 30 minutes
        of our salsa classes, we do Cuban rueda where we all dance together!
      </p>
      <p><b>When and where are the classes?</b></p>
      <p>
        Classes are held on weekday evenings. Salsa classes are generally held
        on Monday and Thursdays evenings from 19:00 to 20:30, and Bachata
        classes on Tuesday starting at either 19:00 or 20:00. However, the
        schedule can change from month to month, so please check our
        <a
          href="https://app.dancecovery.com/home/map/studio/IHDzzcG5WLcLrD20JRrc60GoNI32"
          target="_blank"
          >DanceCovery page</a
        >
        for the current schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The location is usually in F101 and F102 in the Väre building on Aalto
        Campus. The building is connected to ABloc and the Aalto metro exit, so
        you should be able to find it fairly easily. Should the room change,
        we'll make sure to communicate that in the telegram group. Ask one of
        the teachers if you are struggling to find your way.
      </p>
      <p><b>Where is the class sign up?</b></p>
      <p>
        Class sign-ups are managed through our
        <a
          href="https://app.dancecovery.com/home/map/studio/IHDzzcG5WLcLrD20JRrc60GoNI32"
          target="_blank"
          >DanceCovery page</a
        >. Once your membership is approved and active, you can log in, browse
        the class schedule, and apply for the classes you'd like to join.
      </p>
      <p><b>Do I need to have previous experience?</b></p>
      <p>
        You do not need to have previous experience! We offer classes for all
        levels, even if you’ve never tried out a partner dance.
      </p>
      <p><b>Can I sign up for any level I want or do I need approval?</b></p>
      <p>
        For previous participants we always recommend to repeat a given cycle
        until you feel fully comfortable, before continuing to the next cycle.
        This is completely normal, as we keep cycles fairly short and learning
        takes time and practice. You may ask your teacher for advice if unsure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Newcomers without previous experience should start from the first level.
        If you have experience from elsewhere, please contact one of the
        instructors on Telegram or through the association email.
      </p>
      <p><b>Are the classes for free?</b></p>
      <p>
        Yes! Classes are free for members. To join, you'll need to become a
        member through our
        <a
          href="https://app.dancecovery.com/home/map/studio/IHDzzcG5WLcLrD20JRrc60GoNI32"
          target="_blank"
          >DanceCovery page</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p><b>How much is the membership?</b></p>
      <p>
        The membership fee is €8 per year for AYY members and €12 per year for
        non-AYY members. You can apply and pay for your membership directly
        through our
        <a
          href="https://app.dancecovery.com/home/map/studio/IHDzzcG5WLcLrD20JRrc60GoNI32"
          target="_blank"
          >DanceCovery page</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p><b>Do I need a partner to sign up?</b></p>
      <p>
        No, sign ups are always individual. In our classes, we rotate partners
        and we recommend everyone to participate. Dancing with multiple partners
        helps you develop faster and promotes the social aspect of our classes.
      </p>
      <p><b>What is the dress code? Do I need dancing shoes?</b></p>
      <p>
        We do not have a dress code. However, we do ask you to dress
        appropriately for others and maintain good personal hygiene. Dancing
        shoes are not required, but may bring them if you like. Keep in mind
        that heavy winter boots can feel uncomfortable to dance in and will
        dirty the floor, so bringing a second pair won’t hurt.
      </p>
      <p><b>Who are the teachers?</b></p>
      <p>
        Our teachers vary from class to class. You’ll find them in the Telegram
        group with the label ‘Instructor’. Feel free to contact any one of them
        with your questions!
      </p>
      <p><b>What are the social dances like?</b></p>
      <p>
        During our social dances we have great music, great vibes and, if you’re
        lucky, some great edible salsa as well ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        We will have a mix of Salsa and Bachata songs, but don’t be intimidated
        if you don’t know both styles. Someone might teach you the basics! The
        events are held on Aalto campus and are open to everyone. Bring your
        friend or partner if you like!
      </p>
      <p><b>Who do I contact for further questions?</b></p>
      <p>
        If you have any other questions, feel free to email us at
        info@aaltosalsa.fi or contact one of the teachers with the ‘Instructor’
        label in the Telegram group. Bachata specific questions can go to the
        teacher @danielc_1.
